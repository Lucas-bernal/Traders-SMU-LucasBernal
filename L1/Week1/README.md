*Level 1*

## 1. Background in Quantitative Finance

*My name is Lucas Bernal, a first year student at Southern Methodist University studying a Bachelor of Business Administration in Finance and a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. As an active member of the Quantitative Finance Club at SMU, I recently worked with a team of five students towards developing a functional pairs-trading algorithm using machine learning. Through my hands-on learning and application of knowledge I greatly improved my team-work skills and developed a deeper passion for trading and finance. Furthermore, during a recent summer shadowing at StoneX, I gained valuable insight in wealth management, as well as equities and fixed-income trading, commodities, and economic strategizing. I built meaningful relationships in which I gained substantial industry knowledge as well as financial analysis and communication skills from industry experts.*

## 2. Career Goals

*In the future, I'd like to work in an environment where I could apply my knowledge and skills of quantitative analysis, finance, machine learning, and data science towards my profession. I am interested in wealth and asset management with a concentration in quantitative research and analysis. Firms I believe I could greatly contribute to include Renaissance Technologies, Point72 Asset Management, and Jane Street Capital. In 5 years, I aspire to contribute to a team within one of these organizations as a valuable employee, and in 10 years I hope to be creating and implementing my own models through thorough quantitative research and analysis.*

## 3. What I Hope to Learn from This Program

*I mostly hope to learn more about trading and advanced finance from the Alpha Program. Throughout this endeavour, I also aspire to reinforce my mathermatical, statistical, and programming skills with advanced material and application. I'd like to explore new trading strategies and develop connections between my own, creating newer and unique strategies. I'd love to hear more guest speakers from the quantitative finance industry, as I find a learn a lot from conversation and socializing.*

## 4. Current Technical Skills

*In python, I rate myself between tntermediate and advanced, while in java I rate myself as intermediate. I have no experience in R or C++, but within the next few weeks I will be learning CSS and HTML. I rate myself as advanced for data analysis tools such as Pandas and Tableau. I am currently taking introductory courses in statistics, so I rate myself as a Beginner for statistical analysis, and have never taken a financial modeling class so beginner for that as well. I rate myself as advanced in Machine Learning after formally studying it for more than a year and pursuing my own education in it later. I am a beginner in version control.*

## 5. Development Plan & Program Goals

*In the Alpha Program, I plan to deepen my understanding of trading and general finance, as well as reinfornce my mathematical, statistical, and programming skills. I will measure my progress through my participation in meeting sessions and confidence with subjects. While working on personal projects, I devote at least 20 hours a week to developing my programming skills and I rely on lectures from Traders@SMU meetings to deepen my finance knowledge. I'll use a great resource, Quantopian, to learn valuable knowledge on my own time and accelerate my education. My success is to end with confidence in my finance and trading skills.*
